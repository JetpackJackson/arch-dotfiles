# Image previews using Überzug for vifm (vi file manager)

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirala/vifmimg/master/screenshot.png)

This script is used along [vifm](https://github.com/vifm/vifm) to generate image previews for various file types in vifm.


If you want image preview support for [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) check out [cirala/lfimg](https://github.com/cirala/lfimg).


The script is currently able to handle the following formats:
* Video
* Pdf
* Djvu
* eBook
* Images
* Audio files
* Fonts

All previews are cached (except for regular images) and stored in your **~/.cache/vifm/** folder.


## Installation
1. Copy the **vifmimg** and **vifmrun** scripts to a folder that is included in your $PATH
variable for easy access to the files.

2. Edit your **~/.config/vifm/vifmrc** file and add fileviewer properties like so:
```
    fileviewer *.pdf
        \ vifmimg pdf %px %py %pw %ph %c
        \ %pc
        \ vifmimg clear

    fileviewer *.djvu
        \ vifmimg djvu %px %py %pw %ph %c
        \ %pc
        \ vifmimg clear

    fileviewer *.epub
        \ vifmimg epub %px %py %pw %ph %c
        \ %pc
        \ vifmimg clear

    fileviewer <video/*>
        \ vifmimg video %px %py %pw %ph %c
        \ %pc
        \ vifmimg clear

    fileviewer <image/*>
        \ vifmimg draw %px %py %pw %ph %c
        \ %pc
        \ vifmimg clear

    fileviewer <audio/*>
        \ vifmimg audio %px %py %pw %ph %c
        \ %pc
        \ vifmimg clear

    fileviewer <font/*>
        \ vifmimg font %px %py %pw %ph %c
        \ %pc
        \ vifmimg clear

```

3. In order to launch vifm with image preview support from now on, you will need to use the supplied **vifmrun** script.

I recommend that you make an alias in your shell that points to vifm.
